# My trip to Dubai, UAE

Last March, I went on an amazing trip to Dubai. It was super cool! There were so many interesting things to see and do, especially for someone like me who loves art and design.

One of the first things I did was go up the Burj Khalifa, which is the tallest building in the world. The view from up there was incredible! I could see the whole city below, with all its skyscrapers and buildings. It felt like I was on top of the world!
