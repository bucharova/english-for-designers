# My trip to Dubai, UAE

Last March, I went on an amazing trip to Dubai. It was super cool! There were so many interesting things to see and do, especially for someone like me who loves art and design.

One of the first things I did was go up the Burj Khalifa, which is the tallest building in the world. The view from up there was incredible! I could see the whole city below, with all its skyscrapers and buildings. It felt like I was on top of the world!

I had to check out the Dubai Mall, too. It's like a giant maze of shops with aquarium inside, China town or icerink inside. Dubai Fountain is outside the mall. It's huge fountain that dances to music, and it's just mesmerizing to watch.

One day, I stumbled upon the Dubai Design District, or d3 for short. It's a neighborhood where artists and designers hang out and show off their work. I got to try my hand at graffiti at a workshop there, which was a blast!

And let's not forget about all the cool buildings in Dubai. From the futuristic skyline to the traditional mosques, there's so much to see. I even went to the Dubai Frame, which is this big monument with awesome views of the city.

But my favorite part of the trip was when I went on a desert safari. We drove around in 4x4s on the sand dunes, and it was like being in a roller coaster! I also tried sandboarding which is really cooler than snowboarding.

I must say that in general Dubai is very interesting because of the activities and experiences it offers. You can go to jetski trip, 3D minigolf, classic go√≠lf, ski to mall of emirates(2nd biggest mall), free diving, yacht trip with degustation, fun parks, arkades game parks,..so many things to do.

I don't know if this is because it is a rather young emirate, also like other ones (Abu Dhabi, Oman,..) But dubai have almost zero history, they inspired a lot by america, so they dont have like same typical local food. They have steakhouses, america fast food and turkish/lebanons cousine or indian cuisine - so mane indians people moved there for jobs. Its almost like modern slavery, because the have like 30people at shop. One just sayin hi, other goodbye, another smiling, one packing your bags,...crazy. Jobs for everything. Everyone speaking english at city.
