# Voice

When it comes to communication, I'm probably in several stages. I consider myself a non-confrontational person and I try to talk to everyone equally. I think I can adapt to different types of people to make everyone feel comfortable and understanding. I often seem like a "know-it-all". I have read and studied enough and I am not afraid to use various facts that may come to my surroundings as aggressive allusions to their unconscious. But the opposite is that I like to talk and want to share interesting things. 

Sometimes I have stages where I'm not very communicative and rather live with thoughts in my head that I don't want to share out loud. This doesn't happen that often, I'm mostly in overly communicative moods, when it sometimes seems like a monologue, because I like to talk too much.

So far, it seems that I don't like to listen, but I am a good listener, a cord for the difficult times of my loved ones and those around me. I am quite empathic and sometimes I may put myself too much into someone else's role, which I try to resist. In addition to those in question, I also feel the pain and think a lot about their problems.

# Tone

For the most part, I am a smiling person who radiates positive energy. But sometimes I have a very sensitive and anxious mood, when I don't speak and just exist. This is usually at home. In public, I am afraid of showing the opposite of a good mood because of the questions and conversations that may arise and I simply do not want to undergo them.

# Style

My speech is one big mess. I'm full of technical terms and slang, and then I talk like I didn't finish elementary school. I adjust my speech according to the people I'm talking to. It sounds strange, but many of my friends are so different that they wouldn't understand each other. I'm a person who goes to the theater to the opera, the next day to a rave party, then meditates and goes jogging in the morning and mma training in the evening. It smells a bit like bipolar, but no one diagnosed it for me, so it's probably fine.
