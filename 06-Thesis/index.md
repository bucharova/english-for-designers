## CORPORATE IDENTITY

# Introduction
Hello, My name is Šárka and I will try to outline the reason for my work here.
This bachelor thesis deals with the analysis of the competitive environment and marketing communication with an emphasis on corporate identity and it‘s design. The theoretical part of the thesis introduces basic concepts and principles in the field of marketing communication and corporate identity, including SWOT analysis, tools of the communication mix, and relationships between corporate design and brand identity. The practical part of the thesis applies theoretical knowledge to the specific example of Kapka Přírody, analyzes it‘s market and competition, and proposes improvements in the areas of color scheme, logo, packaging, online communication, and website with an e-shop. This small business specializes in homemade syrups, jams, and baked teas. The aim of the thesis is to provide a comprehensive view of the process of creating corporate identity and it‘s practical utilization.

# Why I choose this topic
I don't have a big reason for choosing the topic for this work. I think that this company has great ambitions but has used them badly.


# Process
Market and competition analysis is the main thing for the business environment. This part focuses on categorizing products into the right market segment, examining the market size, its changes, and the speed of changes. Information is obtained from official sources such as the Czech Statistical Office.

Products like lemonades and syrups belong to the food market, which includes a wide range of items such as bakery products, meat, dairy products, fish, oils, fruits, vegetables, confectionery, and non-alcoholic beverages. Non-alcoholic beverages are further divided into tea, ground coffee, mineral water, carbonated drinks, lemonades, and other beverages. Analysis of non-alcoholic beverage consumption shows consumption per capita per year.

In the Czech lemonade market, there are several manufacturers, some of which are affiliated with the Association of Non-Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturers. These producers are involved in promoting a healthy lifestyle and the quality of beverages, both domestically and internationally. Kapka Přírody(eng:drop of nature/piece of nature) cannot directly compete with these manufacturers but seeks to appeal to customers in a different way, primarily in the regional market. There are also other competing businesses in the Czech market for domestically produced syrups, jams, and teas, so good branding and distribution are key to success.

So I found 2 local manufactures which could be competition for my brand. I looked how they communicates their product and tried to find more impressive way for my company.


# Solution
Target groups with homemade production typically appreciate handcraft, originality, and product quality. PR strategy should emphasize these elements and present products as unique and high-quality. Sharing stories of customers who have appreciated homemade products is an effective way to reach this target group.

Engagement in the local community can be another way to reach the homemade production group. Participation in local markets, public events, and support for local charitable organizations helps build reputation and relationships with this market segment. Groups interested in homemade production are often active on social media and online communities focused on handcrafts. This is suitable for community building, where inspiration and stories can be shared to engage this group.

My solution is a diametrically different label design than other companies on czech market. Its colors are meant to remind you of childhood and the fantasy that the flavors of the products have.
