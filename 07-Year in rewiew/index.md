This year has been quite hectic for me. More work than school. I filmed a German commercial for an app. I created a new brand that I successfully launched and traveled to 6 countries. This year has been full of realization about what I want from life after school and that it's getting closer every day.

I can't say much about the commercial yet. As for my brand, it's a shower steam. It works as aromatherapy and is very popular worldwide. For this reason, I decided to launch this product first in the Czech Republic. When focusing only on Prague, many apartments have shower stalls. Shower steam is a new form of bath bombs. Each flavor has its special benefits. Lavender for sleep, citrus for energy, and eucalyptus for better breathing. www.parimese.cz

Traveling is more like a journey for food for me than culture itself. My favorite destination is Turkey, which stands out with its amazing cuisine. In Prague, the best restaurant is Åžef Kemal, which satisfies me during my time in the Czech Republic.
