Hi, my name is Šárka Bucharová, i am 21.
I am Graphic designer
     Digital painter
     Painter
     Web designer
     3D maker
     Photographer..

I focuse on branding that I prefer because I like the creativity throughout the project from A - Z.
Among other things i would call myself more like a mix designer. I jump through techniques depenting in my mood.
At my free time you can meet me in the gallery, but also at rave or gym. I have been doing martial sports since childhood. 
I like the fact that after training you put on your make-up and leave looking like a lady.
